## Data (Slide 3)
#### Motivation and Data Source   
The IMDb Top 250 list [1] celebrates outstanding films, cinema's development over the past 100 year and its variety. However, the master minds behind these movies are not as manifold as the list's title suggests.  
```{r simple-plot, fig.height = 4, fig.align = 'center', message = F}
urlfile<-"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cwerner13/IMDb250_GoogleVis/master/data/Top250%20%28unique%29.csv"
dsin<- read.csv(urlfile, sep="," , header=TRUE, skip=0, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
hist(table(dsin$Directors), main="Number of Top 250 Entries per Director")
```

## Shiny Application (Slide 4)
### Gained Insight
  
  As few as 22 directors created 40% of the entire list (102 movies). Through the decades these filmmakers not only defined cinema, they defined their era: From Charlie Chaplin in 1921 to Christopher Nolan today.  
  - The Shiny App [3] explores their contributions quantitatively  
  - Divides contributors into "Leaders" and "One Hit Wonders" over time

## Conclusion (Slide 5)

### Next Steps
  - Add next year's data snapshot and compare difference
  - Identify movies that couldn't stand the test of time
  - or slowly rise through the ranks with age
